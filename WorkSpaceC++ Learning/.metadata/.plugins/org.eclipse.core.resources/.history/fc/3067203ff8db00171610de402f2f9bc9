-prototype design pattern
-When Should  use
-can we use copy constructor  for prototyp
-When object creation is costly ,to much time
-Cretion ,Composion,and presentation
-Cretion of object and its state are same.
-
-Eg.Chase game example
--------------------------------------------
client
registry
prototyp
---------------------------------
I can take the example of factory design pattern,And escape the creating objects each time,
store creatd object at reposity,while factory creation.When ever use need ,provide the interface
	=to get clone object
	=Copy constructor object.
		=Deep copy
		=Shallow copy
